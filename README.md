    <h1>Machine Learning for OSA Case Study</h1>
</div>

## Overview:
This repository covers the use of different machine learning approaches applied on OSA (Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome) case study, and compare their perfor
- **Regression**: Prediction of AHI (Index of Apnea-Hypopnea), a measure of sleep apnea severity, for each individual.
- **Classification**: Classification of individuals into OSA and non-OSA cases.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Exploration of PCA and Clustering to uncover data characteristics.
## Steps:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Model Selection and Training
4. Results and Comparison
   
The repository also explores some aspects including:
- **Normalization**: Effect of dataset normalization on models' performances.
- **Gender Bias**: Effect of unbalanced data on results when it comes to predictions for male and female subsets.
